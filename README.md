## Mentors
This project is given with intent to work through with mentors at least twice through its duration.  The following are interactions I had with both Heidi and Jonathan:

### Heidi 11/6
- Heidi and I worked on this Monday night.  She helped me with the test spec as I had a difficult time in the Deck class knowing what to instantiate.  It's the Deck class but I had to instantiate card objects since they are the makeup of the deck.  That was confusing and took some time to work through.  

- We started working on the rank_of_card_at method.  I couldn't figure out how to start this and with some loose guiding we got there.  I'm still struggling to create a method without help starting it.    

- I find myself not thinking very clearly when I work through things with a mentor after classes.  My brain and logic muscles are tired! We are working on scheduling some things earlier in the mornings and this week we will plan on meeting again on Friday when we both have time off and flexibility to meet in the middle of the day. 

- It's been helpful to shoot quick messages to Heidi.  Most times I just need a little help, not a 30-60 minute session.  It's the quick things that can hold me up for so long.   

- 11/6/23
Another SUPER helpful session with Heidi going over Constants.  I learned that constants are a great way to establish something that will be static in the project and would cause problems if it accidentally got changed or missed some grammatical expression.  I was able to iterate on the two Constants we came up with to establish a deck of cards with individual card objects.  

## Project reflections
### What worked well for me in this project?
- Wow.  I'm actually understanding things now.  I was able to utilize pry more comprehensively which allowed me to play around a lot with code to get it in order.  Understanding TDD was very helpful as well.  


### What didn't work so well - ie. what changes will I implement for my next project?
- I got very stuck on the runner.  I had the method to instantiate individual card objects into a player deck but had a bear of a time implementing it into the runner.  I got stuck between class and object methods.  Once I got that hammered out I was able to build the deck, shuffle it and split it between players but was unable to build a start method.  I will be going over this project with either Heidi or Jonathan to build the rest of it out to understand how it all works together.  


### What piece of code am I the most proud of?
- I'm writing this in the second day after release and I'm already pumped about developing my own methods and REALLY understanding the entirety of the code, not just kind of understanding what others helped me with.  

- Specifically, I really enjoyed learning about Constants and iterating on them for the card objects.  I was walked through that so I can't say I have ownership of its development but I enjoyed the flow of learning how to put it all together with Heidi.  

- The logic in the Turn class was my favorite part to think through, white board and build out and is in fact, what I'm most proud of.  Being able to complete it 100% on my own is a big win.  I look forward to the day when I can build my own TDD without an interaction pattern.  This is probably why iteration 3 has been so difficult.  Baby steps.  I was so frustrated spending most of Sunday trying to figure out the runner file with next to no progress until an hour before shutting it down for the day.  I figured since I had all day Sunday to work on iteration 3 that I could make some ground so it was really disappointing not to have the same pace there as I did the first two iterations.  I have to keep reminding myself that getting through two iterations is a win for me.

**amended:  This WAS going to be a link I used but after talking with Heidi, she encouraged not going this route as it wouldn't fit my code and may well confuse me more.  That's when we worked together on Constants.  

I'm coming fresh off a very frustrating day yesterday but overall, I've made more movement in this project than I have anything else in Mod1 and I am very proud of this.  I realize there are some holes in my code that would have been exposed as I built out the actual Game but I was looking forward to figuring out how to amend and fix those things as it went along.  I'm disappointed I didn't get to that point but I plan on working with a mentor or rock to build more of this out so I can get exposure to the entirety of the project to take in to the second round of mod1.  I will be turning this project in early to utilize the rest of the work time with a mentor (if he is available) to work through what we can of the runner file.  

A bit shout out to Kat for letting me go this direction.  I needed this going into taking on mod1 again.
